Therefore, it is important to respect and make an effort to understand cultural differences.\r\n\r\n4- Protecting confidentiality: As an Interpreter, you are responsible for protecting people's personal information. Therefore, you should only use their information for official purposes and keep this information secure.\r\n\r\n5- Providing accurate and understandable translations: As an Interpreter, you need to make an effort to accurately and understandably convey the source language text to the target language.
